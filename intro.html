        <h1>A Journey into Baseball Analytics: Stuff+</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Stuff+ looks only at the physical characteristics of a pitch. Important features include, but are not limited to, release point, velocity, vertical and horizontal movement, and spin rate. A pitcher’s secondary pitches are defined based on their primary fastball — with “primary” defined by usage in an outing — and so are judged by velocity and movement differentials along with raw velocity and movement numbers. The model also includes “axis differential,” a statistic that attempts to describe the difference between the movement expected by spin alone and the observed movement affected by the phenomenon described as seam-shifted wake.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Stuff+ was trained against run values, so even if the research community is divided about how much a pitcher can control weak contact, the model includes an inherent nod to the possibility that they do possess some of that ability. The importance of release point in the model also suggests that Stuff+ includes some deception — you’ll find some pitchers with unique release point and movement combinations score very well despite lower velocities, at least. Vertical attack angle is not explicitly in the model, but it is captured by the interaction between release points and movement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Generally, the model aims to capture the “nastiest” pitches in baseball, using a decision tree-based model to capture the nonlinear relationships that exist across release points, velocities, pitch movement, and more.</p>
