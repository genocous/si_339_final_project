            <h2>Data Extraction and Initial Cleaning</h2>
            <p>This data was extracted from Statcast, using the Pybaseball library that works very well in Python. I extracted the specific columns that I was interested in collecting, and then began to clean the data by first changing the column names to be more descriptive. Then, I cleaned the names, moving them from the format "Last_Name, First_Name" to "First_Name, Last_Name". I did that for both hitters and pitchers in the dataset.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>Standardizing Pitch Types</h2>
            <p>Next, I had to standardize the pitch type column, and I mapped all the different pitch types to four pitches: Fastball, Changeup, Curveball, Slider. There were some pitches that I had to group with pitches that did not necessarily fit, but for the sake of the model, they should be fine.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>Creating New Columns for Handedness and Height Differences</h2>
            <p>After that, I created a new column for the handedness of the pitcher, and then created a new column for the handedness of the hitter. I then created a new column for the difference in handedness between the pitcher and the hitter, which I could use to filter the data later on. I also created a new column for the difference in height between the pitcher and the hitter, which I could also use to filter the data later on.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>Creating New Columns for Release Point, Extension, and Spin Rate Differences</h2>
            <p>Next, I created a new column for the difference in release point between the pitcher and the hitter, which I could use to filter the data later on. I also created a new column for the difference in extension between the pitcher and the hitter, which I could also use to filter the data later on. I then created a new column for the difference in spin rate between the pitcher and the hitter, which I could also use to filter the data later on.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>Cleaning Metrics and Creating New Columns for Break and Velocity Differences</h2>
            <p>After that, I began to clean the metrics, making the horizontal break the absolute value, creating a differential break column (vertical break - horizontal break), and creating new columns for the differences in velocity, horizontal break, and induced vertical break, so that I could test these columns in the model later and see if they were useful.</p>
            <br>
    
            <h2>Creating 'Whiff' and 'Swing' Columns and Filtering Data</h2>
            <p>Next, I created two columns in the dataframe for 'whiff', and 'swing'. The whiff column increments to 1 if the batter swung and missed at a pitch, or foul tipped the pitch into the catchers glove, and the swing column increments to 1 for any result where there is a swing involved. I then filtered df into a new dataframe (df_swing), based on whether the hitter swung or not. I also created a new dataframe df_rhp_fb, and applied a mask so the dataframe only contained right-handed pitchers and fastballs. I then dropped all the NaN values from both of those dataframes, ensuring that the model could run without worrying about missing values.</p>
